First being Upper Hurricane creek, two kayaks and my oc1, for first D for all boats. From there into Hurricane creek... This first D was taken a few years back by Adam Goshorn, Matthew Taylor Jones, and a few others(maybe you guys could help me confirm this) all in kayaks. From what I understand many of the rapids where clogged with trees on this run, and some portaging was done. A member of the original party and on my run cut out Hurricane after the original first D. This allowed us to run every rapid, all were pretty tight with plenty of hazard, I'd give it a solid class 4 for micro creeking. Anyways I believe I was the first open boater to make these runs, any info would be  appreciated.","updated_time":"2015-12-17T21:43:03+0000","id":"160558090672531_1018254798236185"},{"message":"I'll have a Demo fleet of these at SRS \"Southern Raft Supply\" for the winter.
